DevXP is a web application designed to make your life easier. We know that learning and incorporating new tools into your project is necessary, but it can often be time consuming, overwhelming, and down right painful. DevXP helps by introducing you to new tools in an easy-to-adapt manner by reducing the number of configuration options, providing explanations in simple language, and even writing configuration files for you.
