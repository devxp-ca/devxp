# Music Purchasing Aggregator

## The problem

In a world where streaming music is the norm, less and less people are buying music. 
This isn't helped by the fact that there are plenty of websites to buy your music from:
* [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/)
* [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
* [Juno](https://www.junodownload.com/)
* [And many more...](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-places-to-buy-music-online/)  
  
Further issues arise when *your* favorite place to buy music doesn't have a song you're looking for.

## The solution

I propose a website which aggregates search results from as many of places on the web you can buy music from into one singular place. 

## Key features

* Clean and minimal UI (Many of the websites mentioned above have horrible UI/UX)
* Aggregate search results for music into one central place
* Account creation for the following reasons:
    * Bind your search history to you to give you music recommendation
    * Create a wishlist of songs you want and receive notifications when they go on sale
* Filter songs by artist, record label, genre, BPM, popularity, length, key, which service gives the most back to the artist, etc
* Connect you to the artists socials to thank them for the dope tunes (Suggestion by a producer and DJ friend)
* Direct donation link to the artist (Suggestion by a producer and DJ friend)
* Possibly a blog/social media style account page where you can comment on your favorite music and follow other users

## Who would buy it

* DJs
* Producers
* Music lovers

## Monetization plan

* Free tier would come with ads and allow basic search, filter, and account functionality
* Paid tier would allow wishlists, recommendations, advanced filtering (filtering by two+ things), customizable account page
