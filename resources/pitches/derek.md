# Music Purchasing Aggregator - Idea 1

## The problem

In a world where streaming music is the norm, less and less people are buying music. 
This isn't helped by the fact that there are plenty of websites to buy your music from:
* [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/)
* [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
* [Juno](https://www.junodownload.com/)
* [And many more...](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-places-to-buy-music-online/)  
  
Further issues arise when *your* favorite place to buy music doesn't have a song you're looking for.

## The solution

I propose a website which aggregates search results from as many of places on the web you can buy music from into one singular place. 

## Key features

* Clean and minimal UI (Many of the websites mentioned above have horrible UI/UX)
* Aggregate search results for music into one central place
* Account creation for the following reasons:
    * Bind your search history to you to give you music recommendation
    * Create a wishlist of songs you want and receive notifications when they go on sale
* Filter songs by artist, record label, genre, BPM, popularity, length, key, which service gives the most back to the artist, etc
* Connect you to the artists socials to thank them for the dope tunes (Suggestion by a producer and DJ friend)
* Direct donation link to the artist (Suggestion by a producer and DJ friend)
* Possibly a blog/social media style account page where you can comment on your favorite music and follow other users

New ideas:  
* An interface with tiles that would help organize playlists
* Tagging system help organize what you might buy
* Stylized "crates" 
* Have things feel in the app like they do in the physical world

## Who would buy it

* DJs
* Producers
* Music lovers

## Monetization plan

* Free tier would come with ads and allow basic search, filter, and account functionality
* Paid tier would allow wishlists, recommendations, advanced filtering (filtering by two+ things), customizable account page

# IRL Skill Levels - Idea 2

## The problem

Lots of things I want to do and study, skills to improve
Hard time focusing on learning these skills
Social interactions really shape my days
How can life be like Runescape? 
* map all the possible things in life to a skill level
* UX would be a google map with events happening around you, anyone can create an event
* Can have paid events for professional teachers
* Have everything predefined for the types of activities

In essence it's a skill leveling app with a meetup aspect
An example: A party  
* Someone would bring speakers, someone DJ, someone run the door

* Recording time would be good to have
* Arbitrary proof of your "level"
* Aggregate how to videos to help users "level up"
* Verify other users skills
* Whole progress through it would be product based, I did this thing and here it is
* The app is just a utility, whole point is to learn

Skills to scope down to:
* Exercise - how many pushups, how long can you hold this yoga pose
* Food - Can you cook healthy food for yourself?

* Interesting idea would be to have online events
* The app is just the tool
* AR avatar as an option 

## The solution

## Key features

* Secure peer to peer application
