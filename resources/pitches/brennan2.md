# DEaaS (Developer Experience as a Service)

## The problem

Many small startups and small technology companies cannot afford dedicated DevOps developers or software engineers with experience in developer experience, or developer tooling.

## Key features

 - Beautiful visual UI
 - Connects to an existing or new project (repo)
 - Automatic project parsing and interpretation (determines language, existing styles or processes)
 - Configurable linter
 - Configurable tester (local/cloud)
 - Configurable deployment pipeline
 - Configurable branch management
 - Configurable coding standard enforcement (commenting, commit formats, etc)

## Who would buy it

Small programming teams, startups and small tech companies, looking to improve their efficiency, code quality, and developer experience on the cheap.
