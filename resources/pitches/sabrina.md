# Collective Small Business Platform

Common art related issues:
- Theft
- Post frequency
- The Algorithm(TM) (includes suppression of external links)

This idea focuses on the last two -- it attempts to solve the 'finding' problem on social media
- eg. I realize someone's birthday is coming up and I should get them some cool art, I follow a bunch of artists but I forget who currently has their shop open or who even has a shop
- I have to manually scroll through my followed list and look for each artists shop (is it open, do they have one?)
- Shipping location would give an idea of timeline and shipping costs and is not always apparent on artist websites
- Another problem it solves are platforms like Etsy and Shopify -- some artists hate these platforms but they feel forced to use them because of the discoverability they provide

## Features
A platform that collectively lists artists and their stores/products (including commissions) (a Yelp etc. for online small businesses + artists)
- Artists would create a small profile made up of mostly external references, including tags for the art style, product type and shipping location (for search purposes)
- Users can 'bookmark' artists and get notifs when their store opens/has a sale/new releases
- Would combine Etsy, Bigcartel etc. stores and have similar search functions to Etsy
- Bridges the gap for artists who just sell a few things online and aren't registered as a google business
- Can apply to many artforms
- Similar to an online artist alley or craft fair but with greater scope
- As far as I can tell there are no other platforms similar to this idea

## Monetization Models
- Ads
- Customizability of profile page (free for basic)

### Some possible specifics:
- Invite only for artist profiles to reduce shady businesses

### Some downsides:
- Would require some form of moderation
