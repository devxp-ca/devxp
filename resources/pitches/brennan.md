# Security Focused Email Client

## The problem

Phishing attacks account for 25% of all data breaches, and reported phishing numbers have been on the rise since 2020. ([expertinsights.com](https://expertinsights.com/insights/50-phishing-stats-you-should-know/#:~:text=IC3's%20report%20found%20that%20phishing,identity%20theft%20(43%2C330%20victims).))  
Security and privacy in email environments is a huge concern for business owners and executives, while employees are unlikely to take the time or put in the effort to act securely with their email.

## Key features

 - Sandboxed environment designed to prevent malicious emails accessing any accounts, data, or applications
 - Automatic sandboxing of clickable links. (Links are opened in a VM, docker container, or at very least a TOR browser tab)
 - Built in email masking (ie write emails using a proxy email which will forward emails to your real address)
 - Textual analysis of incoming emails to warn of potential attacks
 - Built in options to use public/private key exchange (ie, a button to share a public key, then auto encryption of sent emails)
 - "Key information feature" to extract raw text from emails and remove styling
 - Detection of bad techniques with training suggestions. For example, a user sending a password to an unknown email address should be notified that this is likely an attack, with links to personal security training and prevention techniques.

## Peripheral features
 - Better email writing and searching keybinds (regex search, text editor keybinds)

## Who would buy it

A security-focused email client would be purchased by business owners to distribute to their employees to use at work. Extremely large companies may be able to create their own solutions, but small to medium sized companies could purchase the client to prevent data breaches and secure their workforce. Many would have budgets specifically for security or attack prevention, and would find it desirable to purchase a more secure email client, which could also act as training.
